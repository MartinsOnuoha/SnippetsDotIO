## Problem

There are so many Nigerian youths out there who have great talents from music to, artistry, script writing, acting, dancing and the likes. However there are not a lot of open platforms for them to express themselves and connect with the right set of people to help them get to the peak of their career. And we all know about the traditional way of having auditions with so many people in one place and how stressful it is for everyone involved.

## Solution
We are creating a Social Networking platform that connects talents to Entertainment Investors and vice versa.
 An Intuitive Social Networking platform built for the entertainment industry.
-Snippet allows talented individuals post their creative contents online (from videos, script/creative posts, pictures, etc, taking those contents out of social media and putting them in a centralized platform where they have a higher chance of getting discovered by the right network of people.
- Talents can show interest in Gigs posted and be updated with notifications regarding that gig.
- You want to host an Audition and want to screen the best of the best? post it on Snippet and see amazing talents connect with you.
- Talents can follow their favorite Investors/Entertainment Company and get notified when they post a Gig
- Snippet gives Entertainment Investors access to these creative contents and creative individuals and allows them to connect with them instantly. Investors are able to post Gigs.Snippet is built using the LAMP Stack and Twillo Chat API ( for realtime communication and Notifications ).

## WHY

We are building this solution to help talented youths get discovered easily by Entertainment companies and investors, get gigs easily and boost their career without the hassle of standing in long queues for auditions.
We want to increase the opportunities for talents in Nigeria as well as help Entertainment industries increase their arsenal of creative content creators.
